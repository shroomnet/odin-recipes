    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Dive right into the deliciousness of a homemade Mediterranean Pizza! Picture this: a rich oil-based sauce, a cheesy blanket of mozzarella, and a vibrant medley of artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes and zesty kalamata olives. Oh, and the pièce de résistance? Crumbly feta cheese on top. It's like a taste of the Mediterranean, right at your fingertips.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 oz ball pizza dough</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 jar sundried tomatoes in oil</li>
        <li>1 jar sliced kalamata olives</li>
        <li>1 can artichoke hearts</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 oz feta cheese block</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. crushed garlic</li>
        <li>½ tsp. red chili flakes</li>
        <li>2-3 dried bay leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If not already, allow dough to rest, reaching room temperature before stretching. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Strain oil from the sundried tomatoes into a seperate container, setting tomoatoes aside. Combine garlic, chili flakes and bay leaves with the oil. Let marinate for 20-30 minutes, then remove bayleaves. </li>
        <li>Place dough on a clean, flat, nonporous surface. By hand, work dough into the general shape of your pan. Once satisfied, apply a generous amount of flour to each side of the dough ball. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough until it is large enough to fit the entire surface of the pan.</li>
        <li>Apply a conservative amount of oil to the pizza dough, using a silicone brush to evenly distribute the oil. Make sure to cover the entire surface of the dough, crust included.</li>
        <li>Evenly spread mozzarella cheese, covering the entire center of the dough, right up to the edge of the crust.</li>
        <li>Working from the edge of the crust, into the center of the pizza, begin evenly distributing artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes and kalamata olives.</li>
        <li>Crumble a generous amount of feta, and sprinkle over top of pizza.</li>
        <li>Place pizza on the bottom rack of the preheated oven and set a timer for 25 minutes, turning pan halfway through.</li>
        <li>Remove pizza from the oven, place on cutting board and allow to cool for 2-5 minutes before cutting. Enjoy!</li>
