        <li>2 pints cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves peeled garlic, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package Cheese, feta</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup baby spinach</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine cherry tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, red pepper flakes, black pepper, Italian seasoning, basil, and sea salt in a 13x9-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Make room in the middle of the pan and add block of feta cheese. Flip in oil, making sure cheese remains intact and becomes well coated.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cherry tomatoes begin to blister and split, 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>Remove feta-tomato mixture from the oven. Mash garlic and tomatoes with a heavy spoon and mix with the feta cheese, creating a sauce. Stir in spinach and cooked pasta. The spinach will get cooked from the heat of the pasta sauce and pasta. Add pasta water, a little at a time if needed, to reach desired consistency. Mix well and serve.</li>
    </ol>
