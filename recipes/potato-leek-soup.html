    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Whether it's a nippy day or you're just craving an ultra-comforting meal, this potato leek soup without cream satisfies in so many ways. Yes, it's a pretty simple soup recipe (literally just potatoes, leeks, aromatics, and broth). But sometimes, the simplest meals turn out to be the best, and the ones we make most often because they're so easy to make!</p>
