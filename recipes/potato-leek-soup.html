    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Whether it's a nippy day or you're just craving an ultra-comforting meal, this potato leek soup without cream satisfies in so many ways. Yes, it's a pretty simple soup recipe (literally just potatoes, leeks, aromatics, and broth). But sometimes, the simplest meals turn out to be the best, and the ones we make most often because they're so easy to make!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>3 leeks (white and pale green parts only), sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1 quart chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>5 ½ cups peeled and diced potatoes, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 cups half-and-half</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir leeks, garlic, salt, and pepper in the hot butter until leeks are tender and lightly browned, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken broth and cornstarch together in a bowl until cornstarch is dissolved; pour over the leek mixture. Add potatoes to the broth mixture and bring to a boil; season with onion powder and garlic powder. Reduce heat, add half-and-half, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from heat and blend soup using a hand blender until smooth; season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
